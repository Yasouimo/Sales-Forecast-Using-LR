# Sales Prediction with Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to use linear regression to predict monthly sales based on historical sales data. It serves as a great introduction to the basics of Machine Learning (ML), covering essential steps like data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization. Linear regression is a fundamental ML algorithm, and this project provides a hands-on approach to understanding its implementation.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict future sales using a linear regression model. Historical sales data is preprocessed, transformed into a supervised learning problem, and used to train a linear regression model. The project also includes evaluation metrics and visualizations to compare predicted sales against actual sales. This is an excellent starting point for learning the basics of ML.
